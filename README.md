# ESP8266 Humidity Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project guides you through interfacing a DHT11 humidity sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor humidity levels. The DHT sensor detects relative humidity and temperature, providing accurate measurements that the ESP8266 processes and displays via the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the DHT11 Sensor:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to GPIO pin D2 on the ESP8266.
   - **VCC:** Connect to a 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP8266, depending on sensor requirements.
   - **GND:** Connect to a GND pin on the ESP8266 for common ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view humidity readings.

2. **Testing:**
   - Ensure the DHT11 sensor is properly connected and powered.
   - Monitor the Serial Monitor for accurate humidity readings displayed in percentage (%).

#### Applications
- **Indoor Climate Control:** Ideal for monitoring humidity levels in home automation systems.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Use in weather stations for precise humidity data collection.
- **Plant Growth:** Integrate into IoT projects to monitor greenhouse or indoor plant conditions.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Placement:** Position the DHT11 sensor appropriately for accurate humidity readings.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure stable power supply to the ESP8266 and DHT11 sensor for consistent operation.
- **Calibration:** Calibrate the sensor if necessary for enhanced accuracy in different environmental conditions.
